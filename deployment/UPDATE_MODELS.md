# Model Files Update Instructions

## Important: Large Model Files Not Committed to Git

Your model files, trained models, and data files are **not included in the GitHub repository** due to their large size. Here's how to handle them:

## Option 1: Upload Models Separately

### Using Google Drive / Dropbox
1. Upload the `models/` folder to Google Drive or Dropbox
2. Share the link in your repository README
3. Users can download and place in the `deployment/models/` folder

### Using Releases
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Upload model files as `.zip`
4. Users can download from releases

## Option 2: Git LFS (Git Large File Storage)

For future commits:

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.pth"
git lfs track "*.safetensors"
git lfs track "*.json"

# Add and commit
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS"
```

## Option 3: Use Cloud Storage

Upload models to:
- Google Cloud Storage
- AWS S3
- Azure Blob Storage

Update your code to download models on first run.

## Files Excluded from Git

- `deployment/models/*.pth`
- `deployment/data/*.json`
- `deployment/processed/*.json`
- `deployment/quick_fine_tuned_fast/`
- `Literature_reviews/` (PDF files)

## For Deployment

Most cloud platforms (Railway, Heroku, etc.) handle large files during deployment. The platform will download or include these files from the deployment package.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Your code is on GitHub ✅
2. Upload models separately (see options above)
3. Deploy to cloud platform
